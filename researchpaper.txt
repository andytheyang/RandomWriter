ABSTRACT Cardiac excitation-contraction coupling is initialized by the release of Ca from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in
response to a sudden increase in local cytosolic [Ca] ([Ca]i
) within the junctional cleft. We have tested the hypothesis that
functional ryanodine receptor (RyR) regulation plays a major role in the regulation of myocyte Ca. A mathematical model with
unique characteristics was used to simulate Ca homeostasis. Specifically, the model was designed to accurately represent the
SR [Ca]-dependence of release from a variety of experimentally produced data sets. The simulated data for altered RyR Ca
sensitivity demonstrated a regulatory feedback loop that resulted in the same release at lower [Ca]SR. This suggests that
the primary role of myocyte RyR regulation may be to decrease SR [Ca] without decreasing the size of the [Ca]i transient. The
model results suggest that this action moderates the increased SR [Ca] observed with adrenergic stimulation and may keep the
[Ca]SR below the threshold for delayed afterdepolarizations and arrhythmia. However, increased Ca affinity of the RyR
increased the probability of delayed afterdepolarizations when heart failure was simulated. We conclude that RyR regulation
may play a role in preventing arrhythmias in healthy myocytes but that the same regulation may have the opposite effect in
chronic heart failure.
INTRODUCTION
Cardiac excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) works by
local Ca-induced SR Ca-release (CICR), where Ca current
(ICa) is the trigger. It has been suggested that CICR is altered
by changes in free sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) [Ca]
(([Ca]SR) (1–3)). Most Ca within the SR is bound, primarily
to calsequestrin, but the effect of higher [Ca]SR upon release
may be via increased [Ca]i sensitivity of the ryanodine receptor
(RyR) as demonstrated in bilayers (4,3). The precise
mechanism by which this regulation may take place is unclear
but may involve junctin, triadin, and calsequestrin (5).
Whatever the mechanism, increasing [Ca]SR causes a nonlinear
increase in SR Ca release rate, which is increasingly
steep at normal to high SR Ca load (6–12,2,13,14). Such
a steep relationship could have a dramatic effect upon the
overall physiology of the myocyte leading to release instabilities
(15). The role of luminal Ca control of SR Ca
release is not completely clear, though recent evidence points
toward a role in terminating SR Ca release (16,17).
Normal rabbit myocytes exhibit low diastolic SR Ca
release (Jleak) at low [Ca]SR, but this increases steeply with
increasing [Ca]SR (18,14). This SR Ca leak must be balanced
by net Ca uptake via the SR Ca pump (JSRCaP) at steady state.
At 100 nM [Ca]i the unidirectional forward flux through the
SR Ca pump (JSRCaPF) is an estimated 25 mmol/l cytosol/s. If
the leak out of the SR is 4–15 mM/s (18,14), the residual
efflux from the SR will be accounted for by the unidirectional
reverse Ca flux through the SR Ca pump (JSRCaPR,
i.e., $50% of the counterflux). This means that up to 50% of
the diastolic SR Ca-pump flux is in a futile cycle at the cost
of ATP. Such a system appears counterintuitive and raises
the question of what role this diastolic release may play in
ECC.
Complicating this issue further, data indicate that Jleak is
increased in isolated cardiac myocytes from animals in
chronic heart failure (19,20). This effect appears to be caused
by RyR dysregulation, possibly due to hyperphosphorylation
(21–24) and mediated by an increased RyR Ca affinity. The
precise role this increased Jleak plays in the pathophysiology
of heart failure (HF) is unknown, but it is likely complicated
by other Ca handling defects during HF (e.g., increased
Na-Ca exchange, decreased JSRCaP, and decreased K currents
(IK1 (25)).
Finally, because phosphorylation of the RyR may occur
under physiological conditions such as exercise (23) this
raises questions about how altered RyR gating is involved in
altered cardiac contractility. Eisner’s group has elegantly
shown that when CICR is altered by increasing (26) or decreasing
(27) flux through the RyR, the effect on Ca transients
is only transient. The [Ca]i transient amplitude rapidly
returns to near the pretreatment level, whereas SR Ca content
([Ca]SRT) changes to a new steady-state level (i.e., a sort of
autoregulation of Ca transients). These studies raise the

question: why would the cell phosphorylate the RyR
normally in response to physiological stimuli if Ca transients
are unaltered?
Here we examine how luminal SR Ca regulation can be
expected to modulate ECC under conditions where RyR is
altered. We use mathematical modeling that allows examination
of individual processes in the overall function. This
analysis is in some cases impractical in real cells where
simultaneous effects on other interacting systems occur. We
examine the questions: 1), Why is the ability to alter release
at the RyR necessary for obtaining a normal physiological
response? and 2), What role does dysregulation of SR Ca
release at the RyR play in the pathophysiology of the cardiac
myocyte in chronic heart failure?
We find that: 1), increased Jleak has more profound effects
on SR [Ca] and D[Ca]i at low frequencies of stimulation, 2),
luminal SR Ca regulation of RyR gating hastens autoregulation
of [Ca]i transients, thus fine tuning the response, and
3), increased cytosolic Ca affinity of the RyR decreases
[Ca]SRT and could limit Ca overload and spontaneous SR Ca
release under conditions that normally result in higher
[Ca]SRT (e.g., high adrenergic tone); however, 4), the increased
diastolic SR Ca release may result in delayed afterdepolarizations
(DAD) in HF.
METHODS
The mathematical Ca handling model used is described in detail by Shannon
et al. (28) and briefly in the Appendix. The code for the model can be
downloaded from http://www.luhs.org/depts/physio/personal_pages/bers_d/
index.html. The parameters used are found in Table 1. All values for the
parameters below can be found in Table 2 and in the Appendix on a figureby-figure
basis.
Key structural features include four compartments (in series): a junctional
cleft, a subsarcolemmal compartment, a bulk myoplasmic compartment,
and the SR (28). Ca released into the junctional cleft diffuses to the
subsarcolemmal compartment then to the bulk cytosol where SR Ca uptake
occurs.
The action potential was constructed from individual currents found in
the normal rabbit ventricular myocyte. The channels and transporters that
were included are listed in Table 1. Na and K currents were simulated as in
Shannon et al. (28). Ca is exported from the cell by the sarcolemmal (SL) Ca
pump and the Na-Ca exchanger. Both were dependent upon the free Ca
concentration just under the SL membrane in the subsarcolemmal compartment
([Ca]SL). The Na-Ca exchanger included modulation of activity by
external Na and Ca and by [Ca]SL, including an allosteric Ca-dependent
activation site represented as described by Weber et al. (29).
The SR Ca pump was considered to be reversible with both a forward
(JSRCaPF) and reverse (JSRCaPR) unidirectional flux. The net flux (JSRCaP) was
the difference between these two unidirectional fluxes:

coefficient, [Ca]i is the free bulk cytosolic concentration, and [Ca]SR is the
free SR Ca concentration. Ca is only taken up from the bulk cytosolic
compartment into the SR compartment where it is buffered by luminal
proteins such that the total SR [Ca] ([Ca]SRT) is equal to the sum of the
bound SR [Ca] and [Ca]SR:

where kleak is a simple rate constant. The total SR Ca leak rate (Jleak) during
diastole is therefore the sum of this passive leak and the residual diastolic Ca
release through the RyR. Both of these fluxes are responsible for transfer of
Ca from the SR lumen to the junctional cleft space. The net flux across the
SR membrane (JSR) is therefore:
JSR ¼ JSRCaRel 1 Jleak  JSRCaP: (10)
Characteristics of excitation-contraction coupling
The basic characteristics of ECC in our mathematical model are described in
Shannon et al. (28). When square pulses of voltage are applied from a
holding potential of 80 mV, both the peak [Ca]i transient and the integrated
JSRCaRel are graded as a function of peak ICa. The release is also dependent
upon SR Ca load in the manner measured physiologically. That is both the
fractional release and the gain of ECC (R
JSRCaRel/
R
Ca) rise as a nonlinear
function of [Ca]SRT that gets steeper at higher values (2,28).
RESULTS
Effect of diastolic SR Ca leak in normal myocytes
Fig. 1 shows the influence of SR Ca leak upon the frequency
dependence of D[Ca]i and [Ca]SR. Peak [Ca]i and [Ca]SR
increased with frequency, as expected from rabbit myocyte
experiments (31,28), reflecting the steep relationship between
SR Ca release and [Ca]SR (Fig. 3 (2,14,28)). When
Jleak was reduced to ,1 mM/s, the positive D[Ca]i-frequency
relationship is lost, particularly at lower frequencies where
both D[Ca]i and [Ca]SR decline with increasing stimulation
rate. This appears to be because the SR Ca uptake continues
to take place during the diastolic period in the presence of
lower SR Ca leak, ultimately until the SR [Ca] nears the
thermodynamically limiting [Ca]SR/[Ca]i gradient (i.e.,
where the free energy in the form of ATP can no longer
pump Ca uphill (32)). At shorter cycle lengths, the diastolic
period is reduced such that less uptake into the SR is allowed
and less Ca is accumulated.
When Jleak was doubled, as may occur in heart failure
(20), by both increasing kleak and the Cai affinity of the RyR,
both D[Ca]i and [Ca]SR were lower, particularly at lower
frequencies (with little difference at 3 Hz). This can be
understood because at higher frequency there is both less
time for diastolic fluxes to have impact and the much greater
systolic fluxes dominate the behavior. The SR Ca leak might
serve to allow for cardiac reserve that the myocyte may draw
upon as beating frequency increases. Notably, experimentally
in HF the force-frequency relationship tends to be less
positive or even negative (33). Because enhanced Jleak by
itself produces the opposite effect, increased Jleak cannot
explain this hallmark of HF.
Role of the [Ca]SR dependence of release in
normal ECC
Luminal SR Ca release regulation was a novel aspect in our
mathematical model. Fig. 2 A illustrates what happens when
FIGURE 1 D[Ca]i-frequency relationship. Dependence of D[Ca]i (A) and
[Ca]SR (B) on frequency with different levels of Jleak.

luminal regulation is abruptly turned off (by freezing RyR
regulation by [Ca]SR at the end-diastolic value). Thus, declining
[Ca]SR no longer contributes to closure of RyRs. The
first [Ca]i transient after this change is much larger than its
predecessor and the time-to-peak [Ca]i is prolonged. The Ca
transient subsequently returns to nearly same steady-state
amplitude, but the time-to-peak [Ca]i remains prolonged.
Terentyev et al. (17) showed that calsequestrin overexpression
(which should slow [Ca]SR decline) delayed the
turnoff of release. Fig. 2 B simulates this with an abrupt increase
in intra-SR Ca buffering, while holding [Ca]SR
initially constant. Once again, the next [Ca]i transient is
increased in both amplitude and time-to-peak, but the
amplitude then recovers to nearly the same steady state
while the time to peak is still prolonged. Thus, the model is
further verified by effectively reproducing this important
experimental data. The data further suggest that the regulation
of SR Ca release by luminal Ca plays a role in terminating
release.
The role of SR Ca on SR Ca release was also tested in the
model by simulating experiments where intrinsic RyR
properties are altered. Fig. 3 A (left) demonstrates the effect
of partial RyR block, e.g., simulating experiments with low
tetracaine concentrations and matching results of Overend
et al. (27). Upon ‘‘addition of tetracaine’’ (we reduced RyR
conductance to 30% of normal, as ks in Eq. 8), [Ca]i transient

magnitude and SR Ca release declines, but then recovers to
close to the same steady-state magnitude as [Ca]SR increases
over several beats. Tetracaine washout results in an
overshoot of Ca transients, followed by a decline. The data
demonstrate the effects of the feedback loop illustrated at the
bottom of Fig. 3 A. The decreased release results in less
[Ca]i-dependent inactivation of the RyR (on the cytosolic
side) and of ICa (increasing Ca influx). The decreased peak
[Ca]i also decreases Ca extrusion by Na-Ca exchange (INCX)
and, indirectly, an increase in SR Ca uptake. As [Ca]SRT
increases, release increases causing the recovery of the peak
[Ca]i in the steady-state response. The resting Ca also rises
slightly. This is due to the higher and lower total [Ca] within
the cell in the presence of tetracaine and caffeine,
respectively. Though most of this difference is exhibited
by a change in total SR [Ca], some of it also comes from the
cytosol because the two compartments communicate through
the SR Ca transport mechanisms (RyR and the SR Ca pump).
Although the peak [Ca]i appears to be slightly higher, the
D[Ca]i is, in fact, slightly lower once the resting [Ca]i is
subtracted. This is the expected regulatory behavior from
a feedback loop.
Fig. 3 B (left) shows the opposite reaction in response to an
increased RyR affinity for cytosolic [Ca], e.g., in response to
low caffeine as in Trafford et al. (26). Once again, the model
parallels the data as caffeine increases the Ca release (causing
increased [Ca]i-dependent ICa inactivation and decreased Ca
influx) and increases the [Ca]i transient magnitude (causing
increased INCX and loss of Ca from the cell) eventually
nearly the same steady-state Ca transient is reached in the
presence of caffeine as existed before its addition (but at
lower [Ca]SRT).
Once again, the replication of these actual experimental
results in Fig. 3 further verifies the model and confirms its
appropriateness for use in exploring the effects of SR Ca
upon release and the effects of release upon the other Ca
regulatory processes. Having established this, we used the
model to further investigate the importance of luminal regulation
in the feedback loop responsible for the autoregulation
in a way that cannot currently be done experimentally.
The right panels of Fig. 3, A and B, show the response to
‘‘tetracaine’’ and ‘‘caffeine’’, respectively, when the luminal
regulation of the RyR is removed from the model (as in Fig.
3 A). Four things are evident: 1), the luminal regulation is not
necessary for the response or for the completion of the
feedback loop. 2), The speed of the response is slower, i.e.,
more beats are required to respond to the perturbation and
bring about a new steady state. 3), The digital cell does not
recover to a level as near to the steady state before treatment
(i.e., the efficacy of the feedback response is reduced). 4),
The extent of the change in [Ca]SR that is required to bring
about the new steady state is considerably larger. The results
demonstrate intrinsic autoregulation that may keep the [Ca]i
transient magnitude relatively constant (34) and suggest the
possibility that the luminal regulation may play a role in
keeping the changes in [Ca]SR to a minimum in response to
changes in the cellular environment.
The demonstration of this intact feedback loop within the
model is significant. The data demonstrate the role of
changing release through alteration of [Ca]SRT in stabilizing
the physiology of the myocyte and it was important that this
same stabilizing influence be present in the model. It is also
important to note that when the release-load relationship
becomes too steep, this same effect can cause instability,
specifically alternans (15). This instability is also demonstrable
within the model when the Hill coefficient for the SR
luminal Ca release effect is increased to a higher level (data
not shown).
The role of altered RyR Ca affinity in mediating
adrenergic effects on cardiomyocytes
When the Ca affinity of the RyR is doubled (as may occur
upon RyR phosphorylation), there is very little effect upon the
steady-state Ca transient. The effect is functionally analogous
to the effects of low [caffeine] in Fig. 3 B. The myocyte adjusts
itself to generate a similar Ca transient to those present before
the altered affinity and this Ca transient will be the result of
higher fractional release at a smaller [Ca]SRT.
The data in Fig. 4 A represent the relationship between SR
Ca release and [Ca]SR (demonstrated indirectly by showing
the relationship to [Ca]SRT as in Shannon et al. (2)). SR Ca
release in this case is defined as the ‘‘gain’’ of the system or
the integrated SR Ca released, divided by the amount of
stimulus Ca entry (i.e., integrated ICa). Note that when the Ca
affinity of the RyR is increased, a leftward shift in the curve
results such that the same gain is achieved at a lower [Ca]SR
(dotted line). Thus, the only major effect of increasing the
affinity of the RyR for cytosolic Ca is the decrease in the
resulting steady-state SR Ca content at the same gain. In
other words, the same stimulus Ca causes the same release at
a lower SR Ca content.
We propose that this decrease in [Ca]SRT is exactly the
reason why RyR regulation may be important, and the SR Ca
buffering curve in Fig. 4 B demonstrates why this may be
advantageous. Under control conditions (1 Hz), [Ca]SR is

adjustment to the new steady state (27). (B) Simulation of 100 mM caffeine (increasing RyR leak by ;23; Ko,SRCa increased by fivefold), with (left) and

near the Kd for Ca binding (i.e., by calsequestrin, the major
SR Ca buffering protein (32,35). Thus the system is situated
in a position where SR Ca is well buffered and small variations
in SR [Ca] don’t cause large variations in [Ca]SR,
allowing controlled regulation of release on a beat-to-beat
basis.
However, with adrenergic stimulation (e.g., twofold
increase in both ICa and SR Ca pump affinity but no change
in RyR Ca affinity), the [Ca]SRT rises. The relationship rises
up the buffering curve closer to saturation and [Ca]SR increases
66%. Under these conditions, a large amount of the
Ca is free and unbuffered. The large rise in [Ca]SR causes the
RyR to be more likely to spontaneously release Ca increases
propensity for DADs (Fig. 4 C).
If the RyR [Ca]i affinity is included with the other
adrenergic effects, [Ca]SRT increases less (35% higher than
control), closer to the middle of the buffering range and
farther from the DAD threshold. The enhanced Ca transient
occurs with a greater fractional release with a more modest
increase of [Ca]SRT. The overall effect is to stabilize the cell
at a lower [Ca]SR without compromising its ability to
increase the size of the Ca transient.
Effects of increased RyR Ca affinity upon the
diseased myocyte
In HF, altered Ca transport results in decrease in [Ca]SRT,
which is a major factor in systolic dysfunction (36–39). Fig.
5, A and B, shows reduced Ca transients, decreased [Ca]SRT,
and reduced fractional release obtained by simulating some
of the key changes in Ca transport in HF. Here we doubled
INCX activity and decreased JSRCaP by 50%. This decreased
Ca transients, [Ca]SRT, and fractional release (Fig. 5, A and
B), consistent with data in rabbit myocytes (2). However, this
decrease in fractional release is not seen in published data in
rabbit HF myocytes where fractional release was equivalent
to control (40,39); however, see Diaz et al. (41). To further
investigate this effect, we also increase Jleak during HF. This
might occur via either cAMP- or Ca-calmodulin-dependent
protein kinase (PKA or CaMKII) induced increase in RyR
[Ca]i sensitivity (21,22) in a manner like that in Fig. 3 B
where the digital cell is exposed to low [caffeine]. The
[Ca]SRT drops further, but the fractional release is near the
control level at steady state (similar to experimental data
(36,38,39)). Note that the same fractional release at the lower
[Ca]SRT observed in HF (and in the simulation here) results
in smaller [Ca]i transients. Fig. 5 C shows that these simple
Ca transport changes are also sufficient to reproduce the
[Ca]SRT dependence of SR Ca leak measured experimentally
(Fig. 5 C, inset (20)).
Altered RyR gating and arrhythmogenesis
Enhanced SR Ca leak in HF coupled with other cellular
changes, such as decreased inward rectifier current (IK1) by
49% and transient outward current (Ito) by 39%, can also
result in triggered arrhythmias (38). The INCX, Ito, and IK1
changes will tend to depolarize the membrane and deFIGURE

stabilize the diastolic membrane potential (42,38). DADs are
a consequence of increased [Ca]SR. As in Fig. 5 C, Jleak
increases nonlinearly as [Ca]SRT rises (especially in HF),
getting extremely steep at high [Ca]SRT. Thus, a small
increase in [Ca]SRT can cause a large increase in Jleak into the
junctional space that activates inward INCX (and to a lesser
extent ICl(Ca)), which depolarizes the membrane toward
threshold.
The model results in Fig. 6 A resemble experimental data
(38). Digital HF myocytes were stimulated to steady state at
different frequencies, then stimulation was stopped and
DADs and spontaneous action potentials (APs) were monitored.
DADs were not seen at baseline at 2 Hz in control (not
shown) or HF (Fig. 6 A, left), but in ‘‘isoproterenol’’ (i.e.,
double ICa, SR Ca pump affinity, and RyR affinity) DADs
and triggered APs were seen upon cessation of 1-Hz
stimulation (Fig. 6 A, middle). If we exclude RyR Casensitization
in HF, DAD-triggered APs with isoproterenol
are not seen until 2 Hz (Fig. 6 A, right). Thus increased RyR
Ca affinity increased the likelihood of reaching threshold and
causing a triggered AP.
Fig. 6, B and C, shows data on an expanded scale. In
normal cells and the HF case in Fig. 6 B, SR Ca release does
not occur until the AP rises and ICa is activated. However,
when DADs occur the rise in local [Ca]i in the cleft ([Ca]cleft)
precedes and drives the spontaneous depolarization (subthreshold
and AP; Fig. 6 C, left). Notably, even before the
DAD initiation, spontaneous local SR Ca release is occurring
during diastole before net depolarization, yet an AP is not
triggered until the stimulus (injected current) occurs at the
1-s cycle length. This cyclical SR Ca release observable at 1
Hz may be an emergent SR Ca-dependent pacemaker that is
being overdriven by 1-Hz stimulation. However, it causes
a series of DADs upon termination of stimulation (which
decline in frequency and amplitude as [Ca]SRT declines). Fig.
6 C (right) shows that the SR Ca release that is sufficient to
cause a subthreshold DAD (after the two DAD-induced APs,
is undetectable on the global Ca transient ([Ca]i), barely apparent
in the sarcolemmal region ([Ca]SL), but is mechanistically
clear on the cleft Ca transient ([Ca]cleft).
DISCUSSION
We modeled the regulation of SR Ca release by [Ca]SR and
by altered RyR function, and have addressed physiological
and pathophysiological consequences. This has provided
novel insight into SR Ca regulation in cardiac myocytes.
Extensive experimental work has demonstrated that
increased [Ca]SRT activates the RyR at rest and during
ECC (7,1,2,18,14) and the decline in [Ca]SR may also be
critical in regulating the shutoff of SR Ca release (17,43).
There is also strong experimental evidence for a sort of

autoregulation of ECC, where alterations of RyR regulation
have only transient effects on Ca transients (27,13,34).
Diastolic SR Ca leak due to altered RyR gating can also
decrease [Ca]SRT and this can influence the force-frequency
relationship and contractility in HF (21,20). Here we use
computer simulations to test our understanding of the function
of these processes in the myocyte.
Model characteristics
A mathematical model was used to circumvent the
experimental complexity of ECC that makes it difficult to
isolate individual processes (e.g., RyR regulation by [Ca]SR)
without affecting numerous other processes simultaneously.
Though the model is not a substitute for actual data, we have
used it here as a supplement to direct further inquiry into
questions regarding the role of regulation of RyR activity
under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. This
was done in some cases by performing experiments in silico
that cannot currently be accomplished otherwise at the bench.
The Shannon-Bers model (28) has key features relevant to
our aims: 1), the model has luminal Ca regulation of the
RyR. 2), It has a subsarcolemmal space that accounts for
a higher [Ca] just under the SL membrane, but outside the
cleft (44,29). 3), It has several improvements in Ca flux
balance and INCX simulation (45). These characteristics
allow evaluation of SR Ca release regulation and Jleak in the
complicated process of ECC.
We chose to represent the RyR gating scheme as a fourstate
Markovian model similar to that described by Stern et al.
(30). Unlike schemes that are designed to represent channel
activity in bilayers, this design has a strong inactivation
component that allows termination of locally controlled regenerative
release. Though common pool models have been
shown to be unstable in modeling cardiac ECC (46), it is
important to note that this inactivation component along with
the control by the Ca within the SR makes this scheme
workable without resorting to more spatially accurate local
control models that require more computational power. Note
that we were very careful to document both the ICa dependence
and the [Ca]SRT dependence of release (Figs. 5 A
and 6 C (28) and to assure that we could replicate relevant
experimental data from the literature (Figs. 2 B and 3, A and
B) in an effort to confirm that the model was appropriate for
our investigation.
Also of import is the maintenance of a balance of fluxes so
that the proper amount of SR Ca pump and Na-Ca exchange
activity is simulated, resulting in a reasonable level of
depolarization of the SL membrane in response to a defined
level of SR Ca leak (Fig. 6). It is this regard, as well as in the
FIGURE 6 Altered RyR gating and arrythmogenesis. (A) Stimulation of steady-state AP and Ca transients followed by a period of rest in digital HF cell at

design of the various aspects of diastolic Ca transport,
including the addition of a physiological subsarcolemmal
compartment, which can be fairly said to be the strength of
the model (28).
Physiological role of diastolic SR Ca release
Although some results suggested that diastolic JSRCaRel was
rather small (47,48,35), other work has shown that JSRCaRel
is relatively high, especially as [Ca]SRT increases (49,27,14).
Intuitively this large diastolic SR Ca leak seems harmful to
the cell, as it must be balanced by futile SR Ca-ATPase
activity to maintain [Ca]SRT. Such a scheme would seem to
waste energy. So we are left with the question: Does this
seemingly wasteful system have a purpose?
One possible explanation relates to the ‘‘force-frequency’’
data in Fig. 1. A normal Jleak gives a reasonably positive
force frequency (even without additional physiological
effects, e.g., phosphorylation of effector proteins). However,
reducing Jleak to near zero makes this relationship negative.
This is because during longer diastole the cell has more time
to approach the thermodynamically limiting Ca gradient
(DG ¼ RT ln([Ca]SR/[Ca]i)) that SERCA can generate
without leak (32). As diastole becomes shorter, [Ca]SR
cannot reach this limit (see Fig. 1 B). Net SR Ca loss occurs
during diastole, and the more frequent beats bring more Ca in
driving SR Ca-ATPase perforce to increase [Ca]SRT. The
data would suggest that the SR Ca leak is, and indeed must
be, relatively large and that a benefit of high SR Ca leak may
be to maintain a reserve upon which the myocyte may draw
during physiological demands to increase D[Ca]i, complementing
the effects of frequency-dependent acceleration
of relaxation (50) and sympathetic activation on ICa, SR
Ca-ATPase, and RyR (see below). In fact, when Jleak is
doubled, the force-frequency relationship becomes more even
more steeply positive. However, if leak becomes too large
the Ca transient may be adversely affected.
Autoregulation with altered RyR regulation
Autoregulation of Ca transient amplitude (34) is readily
reproduced in the model, for both shifts in RyR Ca sensitivity
and increased SR Ca buffering (Figs. 2 and 3). Increased RyR
Ca sensitivity (e.g., caffeine or phosphorylation) increases SR
Ca release and D[Ca]i at the first beat, but this increases Ca
extrusion via INCX and decreases Ca entry via Ca-dependent
ICa inactivation. Thus, the amount of Ca in the cell and
[Ca]SRT is reduced, which causes the next SR Ca release to be
smaller. If it is still higher than control, there will be further
cell and SR Ca loss, until the Ca influx and efflux are again in
balance with little change in steady-state Ca transient
amplitude (but higher fractional SR Ca release). The converse
applies for things that depress RyR Ca sensitivity (e.g.,
tetracaine). Notably, luminal Ca regulation of the RyR is not
required for this autoregulation, but it does speed the
responsiveness of this process and tightens its control.
Increased SR Ca buffering slows the decline in [Ca]SR
during release and the time-to-peak of the [Ca]i transient is
prolonged. The results are consistent with those of Terentyev
et al. (16), and with [Ca]SR playing a role in terminating SR
Ca release during ECC. However, in our model increased
intra-SR Ca buffering only transiently increased Ca transient
amplitude, whereas sustained enhancement was seen experimentally
(16). The reason for this discrepancy is unclear.
One possibility is that termination of release in our model
depends on both increased [Ca]cleft and reduced [Ca]SR (28)
and we may have too much reliance on one or the other. For
instance, a greater dependence on [Ca]i-dependent inactivation
(as opposed to [Ca]SR) would cause the autoregulatory
[Ca]i transient response in Fig. 2 B to be more like that in Fig.
3 B (right), where luminal SR Ca dependence is eliminated
and the response to low [caffeine] (which increases RyR
[Ca]i affinity) is slower and less complete. Reality is likely
somewhere between the two extremes. Clearly we do not
understand these issues sufficiently, yet. Identifying this is
a benefit of this modeling approach.
In any case, luminal Ca regulation of RyR may serve to
stabilize [Ca]SR and limit changes in both systolic and
diastolic release. Eventually, very high leak or complete
block of RyR-dependent Ca release will prevent the SR from
participating in ECC. However, without SR Ca release the
amount of Ca influx via ICa and INCX increases, and in most
species (except perhaps rat and mouse) this limits the reduction
in Ca transients.
The role of alteration of RyR-dependent flux in
normal cells
RyR phosphorylation by PKA or CaMKII can enhance channel
opening and [Ca]i-sensitivity (CaMKII (51)), although details
are controversial (52,53) and we will not distinguish these here.
Nevertheless, this effect alone is unlikely to alter Ca transients,
as seen for low [caffeine] in Fig. 3 B (26). This raises the
question, what is the physiological relevance of enhanced RyR
Ca-sensitivity upon phosphorylation?
One explanation is that RyR phosphorylation may increase
the initial rate of SR Ca release, even if it does not change the
total amount released (54). Indeed, the model reproduces this
effect in the presence of caffeine (not shown). However, Fig. 4
A raises another possibility. When RyR Ca affinity is
increased, ECC is enhanced in that the same gain is attained
at lower [Ca]SRT (and [Ca]SR). Fig. 4 B shows that this may
allow inotropy, while keeping SR [Ca] on the stable part of the
SR Ca buffering curve. Increased ICa and JSRCaP increase
[Ca]SRT, which would otherwise move up the SR Ca buffering
curve closer to saturation, and where spontaneous Ca release
and arrhythmias occur. Thus, RyR regulation may be an
integral part of the myocyte response to PKA or CaMKII
(along with altered ICa, SR Ca uptake, frequency, etc.).
4106 Shannon et al.
Biophysical Journal 89(6) 4096–4110
Pathophysiological effects of diastolic Ca release
Under conditions like HF where [Ca]SRT may be low for
other reasons as well (e.g., reduced SR Ca-pump and enhanced
INCX function), enhanced RyR Ca affinity may
further decrease [Ca]SRT, accentuating the resultant systolic
dysfunction (19,20). In this case the RyR effect may be
divorced from the synergistic effects of enhanced ICa and SR
Ca uptake that occur with physiological increases in heart
rate and sympathetic activation. Increased Jleak in HF does
not explain the reduced positive force-frequency relationship
seen in HF, as suggested in Fig. 1, but it may contribute to
both reduced [Ca]SRT and arrhythmogenesis in HF.
The reduction in [Ca]SRT in HF depends on at least three
factors (reduced SR Ca-pump function, enhanced NCX, and
increased SR Ca leak) and our simulations here suggest a
more prominent contribution of SR Ca leak than our previous
analysis because, instead of simply increasing a passive
leak, we have explicitly increased the Ca affinity of the RyR
in the model. Thus, the resultant [Ca]SRT decrease is a
function of both the decreased net SR Ca uptake due to the
diastolic leak and the increased systolic release and subsequent
autoregulatory effects (e.g., Fig. 3 B).
Increased RyR Ca sensitivity also results in a lower leaklimited
[Ca]SRT, as shown most graphically in Fig. 5 C. This
could limit contractile reserve. Digital HF myocytes also
exhibited an increased propensity for DADs, as observed in
real rabbit HF myocytes (38). These simulations also show
subthreshold Ca-dependent automaticity in HF cells, apparent
first in [Ca]cleft (analogous to that in normal sinoatrial
node cells (55)) and these may be precursors to triggered
ventricular arrhythmias (Fig. 6). It is interesting to note that
this increased propensity appears despite the fact that the
increased Ca-sensitivity of the RyR actually drops the
[Ca]SRT even more than in the digital cell without this
change. In this respect, it may be the combination of higher
diastolic SR Ca release with the already higher Na-Ca
exchange activity and reduced IK1 channel density that
finally destabilizes the membrane to the point where DADs
trigger APs. Absence of any of these changes likely reduces
the chances of extrasystolic release substantially, as the
reduction of diastolic release to normal levels does here
(Fig. 6).
In conclusion, we have investigated the physiological and
pathophysiological consequences of SR Ca leak within
cardiac ventricular myocytes. The mathematical model that
reproduces many key characteristics of cellular experimental
data has allowed clearer understanding (but also new
questions) about the roles of luminal SR Ca regulation and
SR Ca leak in normal and pathophysiological conditions.
Though a high leak would appear on the surface to be wasteful
of cellular energy, closer examination introduces the
possibility that it may serve to maintain a reserve from which
the cell can draw by increasing beat frequency. An increased
RyR affinity may also serve to keep SR Ca within a stable
buffering range but during HF this mechanism may turn into
a disadvantage, resulting in electrical destabilization of the SL
membrane and generation of arrhythmias. RyR regulation
may therefore benefit the cell physiologically but may turn
into a detriment under pathophysiological conditions.

as the sum of the passive leak (JSRCaLeak) and the diastolic Ca release
through the RyR (JSRCaRel) at the different frequencies was as follows:
When Jleak was double, kleak was set to 16.58e 2 6/ms and the leak fluxes
were as described in the following table:
Finally, when Jleak was ,1 mmol/l cyto/ms, kleak was set to 0/ms, and the
breakdown was as follows:

At 10 s into the simulation, RyR parameters were held constant and luminal
SR Ca was no longer able to affect them. Steady-state parameters with SR
lumenal regulation at this transition were Ko,SRCa ¼ 2.41, Ki,SRCa ¼ 0.245,
